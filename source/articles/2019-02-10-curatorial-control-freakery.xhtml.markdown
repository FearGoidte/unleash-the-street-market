  Are we trying to over-manage markets?

Maybe we should let go to let market’s thrive.

London’s Public street markets are mostly regulated under the [London Local Authorities Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/2007/2/contents/enacted). Many industry leaders chaff under its restrictions and hanker for greater control over product such as that manifested at the private markets like [Camden Lock & Stables](https://www.camdenmarket.com) and [Old Spitalfields Market](https://oldspitalfieldsmarket.com).

Reports on the state of London markets often call for reform of the Act to allow local councils the same curatorial power. It was a recommendation of the [Greater London Authority <cite>Understanding London’s Markets</cite> (2017)](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/20171219_gla_markets_report_web.pdf) as well as the [Cross River Partnership’s <cite>Sustainable Urban Markets: an Action plan for London</cite> (2014)](http://www.crossriverpartnership.org/media/2014/12/Sustainable-Urban-Markets-An-Action-Plan-for-London3.pdf).

When I look at the thriving and relevant markets at Bethnal Green and Whitechapel, I’m not so sure. I could also point to the organically grown lunch markets like Leather Lane, Exmouth Market, and Whitecross Street.

I think that local authorities should embrace their limited opportunity to curate. The hours that a market operates, the services provided (electricity, parking, storage, stall equipment), and facilities for visitors (seating, toilets, busking—parking again) all provide powerful—indirect—ways to sculpt a market without micromanaging each application to trade.

Markets came into being, and flourished, in environments where they were regulated but not curated. The idea of hand-picking each trader is a very new one that favours established traders operating across several markets and limits opportunities for start-ups.

Traders working for themselves, or stall assistants on commission, generally work harder and engage with customers more than staff who are hovering on the cusp of minimum wage.

The job of a market manager is to remove friction between a sales person with a good idea and them being able to trade:

- if they don’t understand the steps that they need to take to setup their business, create a guide;
- can’t fill in the form, fix it; and
- can’t read or write? Fill in the forms for them.

I get better returns working on presentation with a good salesperson that has a solid product rather than starting by choosing an applicant who has great presentation.

Despite the general vanity of the age, I don’t think that my æsthetic choices should determine whether a business is given a chance or not. The London Local Authorities Act gives traders standing and makes them partners, there is nothing wrong with that.
