For people who are not used to shopping on a local market, the retail environment presented by stalls can be disconcerting.

With many stalls, it can be difficult to identify the trader—especially if they are a lurker and not in the habit of being in, or next to, their stall. It can also be difficult to find contact details without directly asking the trader.

Whilst the right to return goods is the same for a stall as it is for a shop; uncertainty over this is a reason that customers are often cautious about making purchases, especially those that are expensive or likely to require after-sales care.

## How managers can help

Display clear contact information for the market management team so that visitors to the market know that the market is regulated and who they can turn to for information or help.

### All stalls

- Developing policies where stalls have clear name plates, with contact details to identify them,
- identifying name tags or branded aprons for the owners of stalls,
- a requirement to display clear prices for products,
- helping traders to understand how card payments can boost sales and how simple using card payment systems can be, and
- requiring any provenance or health claims to be evidenced.

### Non-food stalls

### Food stalls

In Northern Ireland and Wales it is compulsory for food business to display their, most recent, [food hygiene rating](https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-hygiene-rating-scheme). In England it is voluntary and, at least half of businesses do not. Create a requirement that your market’s food stalls must display their score. It legitimizes the stall as a real regulated food business and encourages confidence in customers. If the score is painfully low, they probably shouldn’t be trading anyway.

Similarly, the [<abbr title="European Union">E.U.</abbr>, rashly, allowed member states to draft their own rules for the labelling of potentially fatal allergens in non-prepackaged food](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1169&amp;from=en). The U.K. opted to introduce, and not enforce, very weak guidance. Require traders to list those allergens alongside each menu item where they are an ingredient. That would allow visitors who suffer from food allergies to shop with greater confidence on your market than they can on the high street.

## Conclusion

With a few small changes, I believe markets can build an environment where shoppers feel more confident in parting with their money and traders are maximizing their opportunities.
