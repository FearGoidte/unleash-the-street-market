If you currently run a market, try applying to trade on it.
- How easy was it?
- Did you have to collect an application form?
- Was all the information you provided relevant?
- Did all the questions make sense?
- Where you asked to provide documents with no clue as to how to get them (insurance, food registration &c.)?

Do you tell traders up front what you are, and aren’t, looking for?

Do you encourage people to be street traders and provide them with information about start-up loans and mentoring?

Do you have an information stall on your market? If you’re a local authority market you could offer an information stall as a free charity collection pitch for rotating charities.

If you only offer paper applications and have no internal team to develop one on your website, take a look at online form providers:
- [JotForm](https://jotform.com)
- [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com)

If you are already using online forms, are you using branching logic to ask the minimum questions such as only asking good traders about registration as a food business? Are you telling applicants all the information that they need to have ready before starting to complete the form?

Are you making it too hard to apply and what could you do to make it easier to apply and applications easier to process?
