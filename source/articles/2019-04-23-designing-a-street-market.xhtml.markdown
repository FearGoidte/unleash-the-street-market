This article describes an example layout for a small food and craft market of 78 stalls with 36 earmarked for food and 42 for non-food. The layout is, loosely, based upon one experimented with on Broadway Market in East London. The example plan I have included is for Lower Marsh near Waterloo.

As well as the sample layout, there are some pointers for best curatorial practice/trader mix to create a lively market that gives traders optimal opportunities to sell their goods.

## Trader mix

The market is composed of:

- twelve takeaway food stalls,
- three fruit & veg traders,
- three butchers
- three bread stalls,
- fifteen other food produce stalls such as cheesemongers and cakes, and
- 42 non-food stalls.

On a market, stalls should compliment both the shops and each other. Try not to duplicate stalls. You can differentiate between similar traders like cheesemongers using provenance or price. A market should serve its community and most communities around markets are diverse in terms of income as well as in terms of backgrounds and culture.

## Layout

Where access for fire engines allows, stalls should be back-to-back in the middle of the road rather than facing each other backing onto the kerb.

When the stalls are facing each other it can be more photogenic but it splits foot traffic three ways and smothers trade for the shops behind the stalls.

Columbia Road is a fantastic market but almost impassable when busy and few would argue that the shops behind the stalls get a fair slice of the action.

Stalls back-to-back create an easier customer journey (you can walk around the whole market in one trip without doubling-back. This layout also provides added security for the traders as the back of their stall backs onto another stall and is less accessible.

The layout at the North end of Broadway Market maximizes the footway available to visitors and leaves enough room for the shops that some of them have seating outside.

The example market is in three blocks. At the centre of each block there are four takeaway food traders, these are then flanked by produce traders with non-food traders on the outside. A couple of double stalls are added to each block to reflect that these are often required for bakers, butchers, and grocers.

Where possible, you shouldn’t put cooking next to non-food stalls. The cooking smells will distract their customers and can cause their stock, especially clothing, to smell. Successful takeaway stalls can also generate queues and these need to be managed to prevent them blocking the frontages of other stalls.

Non-food traders often struggle on a mixed market so you should reserve the corner and end pitches for high-quality non-food stalls which are selling mid to high price items. They generally take far less money than food stalls so it is reasonable to give them prominent locations. You could also use these stalls for charity and informational purposes.

Where other roads lead onto the market and form junctions, set stalls across the junctions. You are trying to create a journey around the market rather than encourage people to pass quickly through it.

## Seating

Each block is separated from the others by seating. Whenever you have space or fewer than usual stalls, make up the difference with seating.

Seating may not generate stall income, but it increases the time that people stay on the market and leads to greater sales. You should always consider sacrificing some stall space to seating.

Seating should always be within the market rather than near an exit. You want people to move past stalls to access the seating.

## Equipment

### Cooking and refrigeration

Where possible provide electricity for tills, weighing scales, and lights only. Cooking should be done using gas appliances and food stored in cooler boxes or with ice.

The fridges and freezers used by street traders tend to be domestic equipment not designed to have their doors open and closed so much—commercial equipment features more powerful compressors that have the ability to maintain a consistent temperature even when opened on frequent intervals—so their use is probably providing a false sense of comfort anyway.

Electric cooking equipment doesn’t hold up to being transported and treated roughly, it tends to lead to power surges and tripped fuses. If you are going to have a number of stalls cooking with electric you will need to monitor usage carefully and have an electrician available to deal with any issues that arise.

### Lighting

It is generally better to provide lighting rather than leave traders to their own devices. By stringing together festoon lights, each block of stalls can be lit using just one plug. Providing lighting also means that the stalls stay lit till the market closes rather than have individual stalls going dark as they close. Lots of sales can be lost when a few traders pack-up early and markets look like they've already closed.

## Setup and breakdown

The layout that I have indicated should take a stall crew of four two hours to erect and to dismantle. This depends on the exact equipment used and how much additional work is required such as lighting and tarpaulins.

## Conclusion

<object type="image/png" data="market-layout.png"></object>

Market design is craft rather than science and in many cases the current layout has arisen by accident and tradition. Above are some general observations based on experience.

The geography of a particular street will place limitations on your layout as well as creating opportunities. For example, outside a busy pub you would want to avoid placing craft or produce stalls due to the disruption and possible rowdy behaviour. However, hot food stalls would probably flourish in the same location.

Some traders can be very resistant to change due to a long experience of it being usually negative. However, supermarkets regularly change their layouts for a reason. Frequent visitors to the market can start to travel around it like automatons. Change encourages people to take new journeys and visit new stalls.

If you have anything to add please message me or comment and I will update the article if necessary.
