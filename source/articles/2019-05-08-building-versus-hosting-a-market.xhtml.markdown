One of the strongest sources of sustenance to a thriving market is how easy it is for new traders to rock up and start trading. However, if you don’t provide stall equipment and storage space your market can only host established traders.

## The change

Since the nineties, London Councils have steadily removed the traditional barrows from street markets. This has led to a dramatic decline in the number of barrow manufacturers and suppliers with—as far as a I know—only Bakers off of Roman Road still trading. Previously most markets had yards where barrows could be stored and barrows remain cheap to rent (under ten pounds a week) with repairs carried out for free.

## The response

On [Broadway Market](https://broadwaymarket.co.uk) we sourced market stalls and paid a crew to put them up, complete with tarpaulin and lights. We allocated the assembled stalls to traders. On [Exmouth Market](http://exmouth.london) you were allocated a pitch and brought your own stall equipment with you.

## The result

On Broadway Market the majority of the traders were new to market trading, on Exmouth Market every trader was already established elsewhere. Broadway was mainly incubating new traders and Exmouth was providing existing traders with an opportunity to expand.

If you are not going to provide the equipment and somewhere to store it, you are going to be relying on other markets to nurture traders for you and your market might create jobs but is unlikely to create businesses. Your lock-up or yard might be the sexiest part of your market.
